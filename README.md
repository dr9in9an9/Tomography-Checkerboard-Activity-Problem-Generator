# Tomography: Checkerboard Activity Problem Generator
Created for my Linear Algebra 2 class. Based on Alan Adolphson's, of Oklahoma State, article describing the checkerboard activity which demonstrates the basic concepts of tomography.

NOW FEATURING: 3D visualization!

COMING SOON?: 3D Tomography problem generator... maybe.
