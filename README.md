# Tomography: Checkerboard Activity Problem Generator
Created for my Linear Algebra 2 class. Based on Alan Adolphson's, of Oklahoma State, article describing the checkerboard activity which demonstrates the basic concepts of tomography.

## Usage

Run the program:
```bash
python3 tomography.py
```

This will generate:
1. A random 5x5 mineboard with 5 mines placed randomly
2. An xrayboard showing the count of mines visible from each position (via row, column, and diagonal lines)

See [EXAMPLE_OUTPUT.md](EXAMPLE_OUTPUT.md) for example outputs and detailed explanation.
